Suppose we observe N subjects, each subject at multiple timepoints and we want to estimate a trajectory of progression of measurements in individual subjects. For example, suppose you observe BMI of N children at different ages, as presented below

Here, the connected dots come from individual subjects and the black thick line corresponds to the population mean.

**I've build the package to fit trajectories using matrix completion and I described the methodology in my recent paper [Kidzi≈Ñski, Hastie (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08771).** To this end, we discretize the time grid some continous basis and find a low-rank decomposition of the dense matrix.

![Matrix completion and sparse longitudinal completion](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kidzinski/kidzinski/fcomplete/intro-1.png)

In the classical matrix completion, we look for matrices `W` and `A` that fit the observed points in `Y` (green points in the image above). In our method, in order to impose smoothness, we additionaly assume the basis `B` and again we look for the reprezentation minimizing the errror. 

The interface of the package is based on the mixed-effect models in `R`. In particular, if we are given temporal observations `Y` in the long format with columns `id`, `age` and `bmi`, while additional covariates `X`, constant over time are given as a data frame with columns `id` and, say, `gender`, we can fit the model by writing

```R
model = fregression(bmi ~ age + gender | id, data = Y, covariates = X)
print(model)
```
